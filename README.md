# Work in Progress Polymorphic Pseudonymisation in C#
.Net Standard C# implementation of Polymorphic Pseudonymisation Decryption

### WARNING!
This is a first draft version containing just a rough port of the Java [PPDecrypt](https://github.com/BramvanPelt/PPDecryption) library by Bram van Pelt.
I only understand about half of what's in here and I might not ever be able to figure all of it out.
